Current GLUE Schema Query library functionalities:
get <glueentity> [where <requirement-condition>]

where requirement-condition:
<single-condition> [and <single-condition>]

where single-condition:
<glueentity.gluefield> <relop> <value>

where relop:
>, <, !=, =, >=, <=

where value:
string enclosed with single quotes
number (int or double)
boolean

example queries:
get Site
get Site where ComputingElement.Name='hydra@hydra'
get ComputingElement where Site.Name='SAPAC' and ComputingElement.FreeJobSlots>=4

a few things to note: 
  <gluefield> value is case sensitive.
  string and boolean comparisons can only use a <relop> of "=" and "!="
